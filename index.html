            <p  class = "sectionSubTag text-small">Computer science is the most popular subject on edX and there are outstanding programming courses from top universities and institutions including Harvard, MIT, Microsoft and W3C available to help you get started. Start with an introductory course in computer science such as Harvard’s popular CS50 or MIT’s Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python to learn key concepts and fundamentals. IITBombay also offers self-paced beginner courses in programming including Programming Basics and Object-Oriented Programming that focus on logical thinking and programming best practices. Online certificates are available for all courses and some, such as Arizona State University’s Programming for Everyone: Introduction to Programming, offer the ability to apply for college credit.Next, dive into different computer programming languages. Programming tutorials and courses are available to introduce you to coding in Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, R, C++ and many more. Discover the similarities between different languages and gain an understanding of which language is the right one for a particular task.Want to go further? Enroll in an advance MicroMasters program to build on your knowledge and experience. .</p>

            <p class = "sectionSubTag text-small">India accounts for about 10% of all expenditure on research and development in Asia and the number of scientific publications grew by 45% over the five years to 2007. However, according to former Indian science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, India is lagging in science and technology compared to developed countries. India has only 140 researchers per 1,000,000 population, compared to 4,651 in the United States.[6] India invested US$3.7 billion in science and technology in 2002–2003. For comparison, China invested about four times more than India, while the United States invested approximately 75 times more than India on science and technology. The highest-ranked Indian university for engineering and technology in 2014 was the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay at number 16; natural science ranks lower. While India has increased its output of scientific papers fourfold between 2000 and 2015 overtaking Russia and France in absolute number of papers per year, that rate has been exceeded by China and Brazil; Indian papers generate fewer cites than average, and relative to its population it has few scientists.</p>

            <p class = "sectionSubTag text-small">Information Technology in India is an industry consisting of two major components: IT services and business process outsourcing (BPO). The sector has increased its contribution to India's GDP from 1.2% in 1998 to 7.7% in 2017. According to NASSCOM, the sector aggregated revenues of US$160 billion in 2017, with export revenue standing at US$99 billion and domestic revenue at US$48 billion, growing by over 13%. The United States accounts for two-thirds of India's IT services exports.In the contemporary world economy India is the largest exporter of IT. Exports dominate the Indian IT industry and constitute about 79% of the industry's total revenue. However, the domestic market is also significant, with robust revenue growth. </p>
